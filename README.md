Bashlets
=========
A collection of scriptlets for bash created for various common tasks.
Each scriptlet is in a separate directory


WHY
===
Because it saves time in the long run.

USAGE
=====
Clone this repo locally.
Most scriptlets can be just copied (or linked) into your ~/bin directory.
Each directory contains the scipt(s), README and dependencies if any.

CAVEATS
=======
These scripts are developed by me for a Debian environment.
Most will work just by installing dependent packages.
Please leave a message or pull request if you find any bugs or have suggestions.
