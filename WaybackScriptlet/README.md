Wayback Scriptlet
========
A javascript bookmarket that will save the current page to the wayback machine
(internet archive; archive.org)
This is especially useful when writing papers / articles that refer to websites
and online content that is likely to disappear over time; breaking links in the
references cited.

To use, create a bookmark in your browser (preferably on the bookmarks bar or
similar). The bookmark title can be anything you want; the URL should be the
URL in the accompanying text file.

ToDO:
Make the bookmarklet draggable. Will look into this if/when I make a github
pages version of this repo.
