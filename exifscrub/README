EXIFSCRUB
=========
A quick script to scrub exif information from your photos, and optionally to add your own.

Installation:
-------------
1. Open the file exifscrub with a text editor and change the string in the copyright field as you would like it.
2. Copy the file exifscrub to your ~/bin and ensure that execute permissions are enabled.
 

Usage:
------
$> exifscrub filename

Examples:
---------
Scrub a single file:
$> exifscrub dsc003263.jpg

Scrub all files in a directory:
$> for file in *.jpg; do exifscrub $file; done; mkdir originals; mv *.jpg_original ./originals/

NOTES:
------
exifscrub can currently handle only one file at a time. If you want to operate on multiple files you should be writing loops that call exifscrub per file. This is by design.
